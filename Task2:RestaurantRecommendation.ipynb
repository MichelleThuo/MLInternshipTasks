        "## 1. Personalized Dining Suggestions\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. Time-Saving\n",

        "The system can be adapted to include additional features like location, user ratings, or specific dietary needs, making it versatile for different scenarios.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. Limited Feature Scope\n",
        "The recommendation is based only on 'Cuisines' and 'Price range'. Other factors like location, availability of online delivery, or ratings could be incorporated for better personalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Zero Ratings\n",
        "Some restaurants might have zero ratings or missing ratings. These could be excluded from the recommendations or treated as unrated.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Model Evaluation\n",
        "## 1. Manual Inspection\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. User Feedback\n",
        "If possible, collect user feedback on the recommendations to refine the system.\n",
